# Data Request Letter for Kigombya Primary School

**To:** The Administration  
**Kigombya Primary School**  
**Mukono, Uganda**

**Subject:** Request for Data to Support Database Development Project

---

Dear School Administration,

I am a student at Uganda Christian University pursuing a course in Database Programming (CSC2209). As part of my research project, I am developing a School Management Information System that aims to improve administrative efficiency and student record management in primary schools.

I am writing to kindly request your assistance in providing relevant data that will help me design and develop this database system. This project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education) and aims to demonstrate how technology can support educational institutions.

## Data Needed

To develop a functional system, I would appreciate access to the following information:

### 1. **Student Records**
- Student names, registration numbers, dates of birth, gender
- Contact addresses and parent/guardian information
- Current class levels and enrollment dates
- Academic performance records (if available)

### 2. **Staff Information**
- Staff names, positions, and contact details
- Subject assignments and class responsibilities

### 3. **Academic Structure**
- Class levels offered (P.1 through P.7)
- Subjects taught at each level
- Academic calendar information

### 4. **Operational Data**
- Attendance records (sample data)
- Fee structure and payment records (if applicable)

**Note:** I understand the sensitivity of personal information. All data will be used solely for academic purposes, and I will implement appropriate security measures. You may provide anonymized or sample data if preferred.

## Benefits to the School

Upon completion, the school may benefit from:
- A demonstration of how a digital system could improve record management
- Insights into database design for educational institutions
- Potential recommendations for system implementation

## Timeline

I would appreciate receiving the data by **[Insert Date]** to allow sufficient time for system development and testing.

## Contact

Please feel free to contact me if you need any clarification or have questions about this request.

**Thank you for your consideration and support of this academic research project.**
